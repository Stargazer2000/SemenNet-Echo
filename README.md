# SemenNet-Echo: Two-Branch Information-Enhanced Multi-Objective Semantic Segmentation Network for Echocardiographic Images

This repository contains the implementation of the SemenNet, a two-branch multi-objective semantic segmentation network designed for echocardiographic images. The network enhances semantic and spatial information to improve the segmentation results of regions of interest in echocardiographic images.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Information Enhancement**: Learns the semantic contextual correlation between pixels and their neighbors to correct the original feature maps.
- **Spatial Information Enhancement**: Processes feature maps with rich spatial structural information.
- **Effective Feature Fusion**: Optimizes the way to fuse different types of feature maps for better segmentation results.
